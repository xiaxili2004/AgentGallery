      "The key points about the State Key Laboratories (SKLs) in Hong Kong include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Background and Management**: Launched in 1984, the SKL scheme is managed by the Mainland's Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). It focuses on nurturing both basic and applied technology research and development, with a high status signifying recognition from MOST.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Restructuring Initiative**: In 2022, MOST initiated an optimization and restructuring of SKLs, requiring them to address significant national scientific needs and clearly define their mission and positioning. Post-restructuring, the Chinese name for these labs will change from “国家重点实验室” to “全国重点实验室,” though the English title remains unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evaluation Criteria**:\n",
      "   - **Mission and Positioning**: Must align with national development strategies and leverage Hong Kong’s international advantages.\n",
      "   - **Research Level and Impact**: Should be internationally advanced, supporting major national needs and critical core technologies.\n",
      "   - **Talent and Team**: Requires a high-level research team, with the director being an influential scholar in the field.\n",
      "   - **Operational Management and Support**: Needs efficient and organized structures with sound operational management.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Recent Assessments**: All 16 SKLs in Hong Kong were re-assessed in 2016-2017 and 2022-2023, with 10 rated as \"outstanding\" and 6 as \"meritorious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Specific Labs**: Examples of SKLs in Hong Kong include those focused on Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Digestive Disease, Advanced Displays and Optoelectronics Technologies, and branches of National Engineering Research Centers in various fields.\n",

      "Question: What is the government's policy on research funding?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "The government's policy on research funding, as outlined in the provided context, includes the following key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Funding Amount and Scope**: The government proposes to provide funding support between $100 million and $300 million for each successful application under the Scheme, aiming to support around 10 to 30 projects. This is intended to strengthen institutions' research capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Matching Basis Funding**: Funding is provided on a matching basis. For researcher/scholar remuneration, the matching ratio is up to 1:1 (Government: applicant institution and other funding). For other expenses, the matching ratio can be up to 4:1 (Government: applicant institution and other sources), which may include both in-kind and non-in-kind support.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Operational Requirements**: Successful applicants must enter into an agreement with the Government, ensuring that the research facility commences operation within 18 months from the signing of the agreement and operates for at least five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Monitoring and Reporting**: The applicant institution is responsible for closely monitoring the implementation progress and reporting to the Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC). Funding disbursement is based on R&D progress, cash flow needs, and the actual contribution from the university and/or industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: If the project fails to meet the terms of the agreement, including unsatisfactory performance or breach of funding conditions, the Government reserves the right to terminate the agreement, cease funding, and request the return of any disbursed funds.\n",

      "The government supports innovation through financial assistance and the creation of dedicated funds. Specifically, it plans to create a new subhead of $3 billion under the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) to implement a scheme that promotes the downstream development of new industrialization. This includes providing financial support to companies in strategic industries such as life and health technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and data science. Additionally, the government is seeking approval for a $6 billion non-recurrent commitment to set up a Subsidy Programme, which will be administered by a Secretariat and an Assessment Committee. The Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau and the Innovation and Technology Commission will continue to work with stakeholders to refine these programs.\n",
